# AdvancedTriviaGame
I will create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, I have to show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, I will display the next question -- this must be done without user input.  The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.   If the player runs out of time, will tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. The program has to Wait a few seconds, then show the next question. If the player chooses the wrong answer, will tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Thwn wait a few seconds, then show the next question.   On the final screen, I will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
